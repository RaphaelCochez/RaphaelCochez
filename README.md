## Hi there 👋

I'm **Raphael Cochez**, someone interested in complex systems, automation, and real-world problem solving.  
I enjoy working on difficult problems and continuously expanding what I know.

### 🌍 Sustainability
I care deeply about environmental sustainability, with a particular focus on pollution, energy efficiency, and waste management and recycling. 
Rather than focusing on statements or slogans, I am motivated to contribute through practical things. Building systems and tools that support environmental insight and improvement, with the intention of developing this further through research.

### 🔧 What I Work On
- Embedded and sensor-driven systems  
- Engineering tools for automation and analysis  
- Hardware–software integration under real-world constraints  
- Research-oriented system design and validation  

---

### 🧠 How I Work
My GitHub serves as a **working knowledge base**. You’ll find:
- Course summaries and technical notes  
- Self-written explanations of complex topics  
- Documented experiments and exploratory projects  
- Tools built to automate repetitive engineering tasks  

---

### 🛠️ Technical Focus
- **Embedded:** C/C++, ESP32, STM32, Arduino  
- **Software:** Python, Java, Linux  
- **Data & AI:** Signal processing, NLP, ML  
- **Design:** PCB design, hardware validation

### 📄 AutoDocument — Offline AI Documentation Tool
A **recent side project** built to automate large documentation tasks by analyzing file system structure and content.

- Recursive scanning and metadata extraction  
- NLP-based summaries and keyword extraction  
- Duplicate detection via content hashing  
- Export to `.json`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`  
- Fully offline after model download  

Used for generic documentation of large codebases, archives, datasets, and rapid folder inspection.  
Still being refined to better handle complex file formats.
